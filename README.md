# My Personal Website

![image](/screenshot.png)

My personal portfolio website and blog. Part of it was a school assignment for my Higher Proffesional Degree in [Front End Development](https://www.noroff.no/en/studies/vocational-school/front-end-development) at [Noroff School of technology and digital media](https://www.noroff.no/en/), but most of it is because I wanted to redo my personal website and wanted a place to write down what I have learned about web development.
